# Bamazon
> Amazon-like storefront

A command line node application using MySQL to create an Online Puppy Supply Store.

## Customer View

Bamazon: Puppy Supply Store will display a menu of items for purchase and update stock quantity of item from the store's inventory based on the customer's purchase. 

### How It Works
The customer will enter `node bamazonCustomer` in the command line and the greeting and the table of products for sale will be displayed.

The customer will be asked to `Shop by Item ID` and then asked `How many would you like to buy?`. If the customer chooses a quantity that is larger than what is in stock, they will see  `"Sorry, not enough quantity to fill your order"` 

**NPM** 
CLI Table - for the tables
Color.js - colors

*Unfinished Items*
Once you make your selection, the quantity will update in the database and display the total price of your purchase.
